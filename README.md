## How I built the Memory Game
I manipulated the DOM with JavaScript, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play time by sections
* added effects to cards when they are unmatched (shake)
* added reset button to reset the game it will shuffle the cards and reset the previous moves and match counter
